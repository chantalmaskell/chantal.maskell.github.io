Hi there, nice to meet you!

I'm fairly new to being a Software Engineer, having found my first role at a tech consultancy about a year ago. Currently, I'm studying part-time in the evenings for a Masters in Computer Science, which has enabled me to explore new areas like Multi-Agent Systems, Robotics, and Machine Learning.

Other than work and study, I'm into (or just talking about) running. I've mostly been a casual runner, but I'm keen to try out more ultra-distances at some point.

Currently working on broadening my knowledge of dotnet, and this is what I'm working on in my main role. Hoping to find the time to develop this into some personal projects soon though :)
